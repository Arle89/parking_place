Hi, my name is Danil. And it's my Parking!
To chek working on, just run chek_script by VScode.
Logic is simple, here is parking with lines and places.
All objects have own class, own attributes and methods
Classes of vehicle, it's childs from parking.
To park in some vehicle we're calling parking method of needed vehicle type
To park off call method unparking.
Parking method search empty place in correct lines for vehicle type
Create instance of need class and place it on empty place


Maybe not all is perfect, wait for feedback))
